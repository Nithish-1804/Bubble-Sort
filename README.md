# Bubble Sorting Algorithm
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which means the list is sorted.

## How Bubble Sort Works
1. **Comparisons and Swaps**: Bubble Sort works by making multiple passes through the list. In each pass, adjacent elements are compared. If they are out of order, they are swapped.
1. **Largest Element "Bubbles Up"**: During each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the list.
1. **Repeat Until Sorted**: The process is repeated for each element in the list until no more swaps are needed. This guarantees that the list is sorted.

## Uses of Bubble Sort
1. **Simple Sorting**: Bubble Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that is often used for educational purposes to teach the concept of sorting.
1. **Small Datasets**: It can be used for sorting small datasets or lists where its simplicity may outweigh its inefficiency.

## Advantages of Bubble Sort
1. **Simplicity**: Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms to understand and implement, making it a valuable educational tool.
1. **In-Place Sorting**: Bubble Sort sorts the list in place, which means it doesn't require additional memory for temporary storage.
1. **Stable Sorting**: Bubble Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it does not change the relative order of equal elements.
1. **Deterministic**: Bubble Sort has a predictable behavior and always takes the same number of steps to sort a list of a given size.
